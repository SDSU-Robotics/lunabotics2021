CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstring.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "string", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "string" with any
  of the following names:

    stringConfig.cmake
    string-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "string" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "string_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "string"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
